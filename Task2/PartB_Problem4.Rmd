## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

dir1 <- "/Users/nikhilg/Downloads/NCAA-D1-APR-2003-14/DS0001"
path <- file.path(dir1, "26801-0001-Data.tsv")
apd <- read.csv(path, sep="\t")
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, out.width='50%'}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("reshape2")

apd <- apd %>%
  select(-DATA_TAB_GENERALINFO) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with("APR_RATE"),
               names_to="YEAR", values_to="APR") %>%
  select(SCL_UNITID, SCL_NAME, SPORT_CODE, SPORT_NAME, YEAR, APR) %>%
  mutate(YEAR=as.numeric(stringr::str_sub(YEAR, start=10, 13)))
apd
```

```{r}
apd_gender <- apd %>%
  filter(SPORT_CODE != 38) %>%
  mutate(GENDER = ifelse(SPORT_CODE < 19, "Men's", "Women's"))
ggplot(apd_gender) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=as.factor(YEAR), y=APR, color=GENDER)) +
  labs(x="Year", y="Academic Progress Rate", color="Gender",
       title="Women's sports have higher APRs than men's 2004-2014") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Years Vs APR for Men and Women

From the plot we can see that there is a steady increase in the Academic Progress Rate of both Mena and Women over the period of 2004-2014. Even there is a significant difference between them 
APR of Men and Women. By comparing the plot we can come to the conclusion that the APR of women is significantly higher than men.
